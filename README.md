# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses MSW in the browser and also in node for testing purposes. I've experimented with putting the components in a features folder and 
the views in a pages folder, the unit tests live alongside the feature that uses them. It demonstrates the use of RTK Query with typescript
and unit tests. It also has some form validation and a number of other features. I've also tried to be mindfull of Kent C Dodds Testing Trophy, testing what the user interacts with as opposed to testing implementation details https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests
